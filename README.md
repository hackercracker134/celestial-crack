   - When prompted, enter the hosting address `127.0.0.1` and the port `25568`.

2. **Configure Celestial.exe:**
   - Without closing the terminal running the server, open `celestial.exe`.
   - In the app, set the installation folder and adjust the memory allocation (RAM).

Once the server is running, access it via `http://127.0.0.1:25568` in your web browser or client.

## Troubleshooting
